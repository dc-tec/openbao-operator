                      decrypt traffic. The Gateway listener must be configured with protocol: TLS and mode: Passthrough.

                      This is required on some CNI implementations where egress enforcement happens on the post-NAT

                      Use this in restricted environments where the operator cannot list EndpointSlices/Endpoints in
                      the default namespace to auto-detect endpoint IPs.

                      services such as transit seal backends, object storage endpoints, or other dependencies.

                      The operator's default egress rules (DNS, API server, cluster pods) are always included

                  SelfInit configures OpenBao's native self-initialization feature.
                  When enabled, OpenBao initializes itself on first start using the configured
                  requests, and the root token is automatically revoked.
                  See: https://openbao.org/docs/configuration/self-init/

                      BootstrapJWTAuth, when true, enables automatic JWT authentication bootstrap
                      for the operator. This configures JWT auth in OpenBao, sets up OIDC discovery,
                      creates the operator policy and role, and optionally creates backup/upgrade
                      policies and roles if those features are configured with JWTAuthRole.

                      When false (default), JWT auth must be manually configured via SelfInit requests.
                      This is the recommended approach for users who want full control over JWT auth setup.

                      Bootstrap requires:
                      - OIDC issuer URL to be discoverable at operator startup
                      - OIDC JWKS public keys to be available at operator startup

                      When true, the Operator injects initialize stanzas into config.hcl

                  Upgrade configures upgrade operations.

                  When spec.upgrade.preUpgradeSnapshot is true, if upgrade authentication is not
                  Upgrade authentication must be explicitly configured via spec.upgrade.jwtAuthRole
                  or spec.upgrade.tokenSecretRef. The operator automatically creates an upgrade ServiceAccount
                  (<cluster-name>-upgrade-serviceaccount) for JWT Auth authentication.
                properties:
                  executorImage:
                    description: |-
                      ExecutorImage is the container image to use for upgrade operations.

                      This image is used by Kubernetes Jobs created during upgrades (for example, blue/green
                      cluster orchestration actions). The executor runs inside the tenant namespace and
                      authenticates to OpenBao using a projected ServiceAccount token (JWT auth).
                    type: string
                  jwtAuthRole:
                    description: |-
                      JWTAuthRole is the name of the JWT Auth role configured in OpenBao
                      for upgrade operations. When set, the upgrade manager will use JWT Auth
                      (projected ServiceAccount token) instead of a static token. This is the preferred authentication
                      method as tokens are automatically rotated by Kubernetes.

                      The role must be configured in OpenBao and must grant:
                      - "read" capability on sys/health
                      - "update" capability on sys/step-down
                      - "read" capability on sys/storage/raft/snapshot (if preUpgradeSnapshot is enabled)
                      The role must bind to the upgrade ServiceAccount (<cluster-name>-upgrade-serviceaccount),
                      which is automatically created by the operator.

                      Either JWTAuthRole or TokenSecretRef must be set for upgrade operations.
                    type: string
                  preUpgradeSnapshot:
                    description: |-
                      PreUpgradeSnapshot, when true, triggers a backup before any upgrade.
                      When enabled, the upgrade manager will create a backup using the backup
                      configuration (spec.backup.target, spec.backup.executorImage, etc.) and
                      wait for it to complete before proceeding with the upgrade.

                      If the backup fails, the upgrade will be blocked and a Degraded condition
                      will be set with Reason=PreUpgradeBackupFailed.

                      Requires spec.backup to be configured with target, executorImage, and
                      authentication (jwtAuthRole or tokenSecretRef).

                      TokenSecretRef optionally references a Secret containing an OpenBao API
                      token to use for upgrade operations.

                      The token must have permission to:
                      - read sys/health
                      - update sys/step-down
                      - read sys/storage/raft/snapshot (if preUpgradeSnapshot is enabled)

                      Either JWTAuthRole or TokenSecretRef must be set for upgrade operations.
                      If JWTAuthRole is set, this field is ignored in favor of JWT Auth.
