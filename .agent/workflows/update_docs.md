This workflow is for working on the project documentation.

# Preview Documentation

Start a local server to preview changes to the documentation:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

# Generate Config

If you need to verify or regenerate any configuration related docs (if applicable via valid make targets):

```bash
make generate
```
