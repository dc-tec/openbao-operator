# This rule is not used by the project openbao-operator itself.
# It is provided to allow the cluster admin to help manage permissions for users.
#
# Grants permissions to create, update, and delete OpenBaoCluster resources.
# This role is intended for users who need to manage these resources
# but should not control RBAC or manage permissions for others.
#
# Multi-tenancy: This ClusterRole can be bound to users/groups via ClusterRoleBinding
# for cluster-wide editor access, or via RoleBinding for namespace-scoped editor access.
