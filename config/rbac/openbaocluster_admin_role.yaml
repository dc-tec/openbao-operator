# It is provided to allow the cluster admin to help manage permissions for users.
#
# Grants full permissions ('*') over openbao.org/v1alpha1 OpenBaoCluster resources.
# This role is intended for users authorized to modify roles and bindings within the cluster,
# enabling them to delegate specific permissions to other users or groups as needed.
#
# Multi-tenancy: This ClusterRole can be bound to users/groups via ClusterRoleBinding
# for cluster-wide admin access, or via RoleBinding for namespace-scoped admin access.
