# This rule is not used by the project openbao-operator itself.
# It is provided to allow the cluster admin to help manage permissions for users.
#
# Grants read-only access to OpenBaoCluster resources.
# This role is intended for users who need visibility into these resources
# without permissions to modify them. It is ideal for monitoring purposes and limited-access viewing.
#
# Multi-tenancy: This ClusterRole can be bound to users/groups via ClusterRoleBinding
# for cluster-wide viewer access, or via RoleBinding for namespace-scoped viewer access.
