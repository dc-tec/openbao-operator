# OpenBaoCluster with Hardened Security Profile
#
# This example demonstrates a production-ready OpenBao cluster using the Hardened
# security profile. The Hardened profile enforces strict security requirements:
# - External TLS management (cert-manager or CSI)
# - External KMS for auto-unseal (no static keys in Kubernetes Secrets)
# - Self-initialization enabled (no root token stored)
# - JWT authentication automatically bootstrapped
#
# IMPORTANT: The Hardened profile is REQUIRED for production deployments.
# The Development profile stores root tokens in Kubernetes Secrets, which
# poses a significant security risk in production environments.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - cert-manager installed (or another external TLS provider)
# - AWS KMS key created (or another external KMS provider)
# - CA and server certificate Secrets must be created before deployment
#
