          OpenBaoTenant is the Schema for the openbaotenants API.
          OpenBaoTenant is a governance CRD that explicitly declares which namespace
          should be provisioned with tenant RBAC. This replaces the previous label-based
          approach (openbao.org/tenant=true) to improve security by eliminating the need
          for the Provisioner to have list/watch permissions on namespaces.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                  resources in that namespace.
