Path: `Controller JWT lifecycle > renews Target credentials and recovers an initialized migration from an older snapshot`

State: `active`

Generated fallback ID: `controller-jwt-renews-target-credentials-and-recovers-an-d3ad7cce`

Recorded checkpoints:
- bootstrapping Target mode with the operator-generated roles and policy approval
- initializing an existing-style Shared cluster and saving its actual Raft snapshot
- preparing the existing role, switching the CR, then removing shared trust
- restoring the pre-migration snapshot while the CR remains in Target mode
- repairing restored audience trust through the independent administrator login
- keeping the same controller process alive beyond the initial JWT's ten-minute lifetime
- repairing a deleted operational policy using the renewed Target credential
