State: `active`

Covers: _none_

Labels: `lifecycle`, `cluster`, `profile-development`

Labels: `lifecycle`, `cluster`, `profile-development`, `scaling`, `autopilot`, `smoke`

Recorded checkpoints:
- waiting for StatefulSet to be ready with 1 replica
- waiting for Available condition

- verifying Raft Autopilot min_quorum=1 (Development profile with 1 replica)


## `cluster-lifecycle-scales-down-to-1-replica-remains-f03c312f`

State: `active`

Covers: _none_

Labels: `lifecycle`, `cluster`, `profile-development`, `scaling`, `autopilot`, `smoke`

Recorded checkpoints:
- updating cluster to 1 replica
- waiting for StatefulSet to scale down to 1 replica
- waiting for the remaining pod to be ready
- waiting for Available condition after scale down
- getting public service for autopilot verification
- triggering reconcile after scale down so autopilot settings are refreshed promptly
- verifying Raft Autopilot min_quorum=1 (Development profile with 1 replica)
- verifying the remaining cluster still serves JWT-authenticated KV traffic
