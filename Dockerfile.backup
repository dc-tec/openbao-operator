# Backup executor image
#
# This Dockerfile builds a minimal container image for the backup executor
# process used by the OpenBao backup Job. The executor binary is built from
# source in a multi-stage build. The image is configured to run as a non-root
# user, matching the PodSecurityContext used by the backup Job (UID 1000, GID 1000).
#
# Example build (from repo root):
#   docker build -f Dockerfile.backup -t openbao-backup:dev .
