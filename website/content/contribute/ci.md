Pull-request CI routes checks by changed path and risk. Nightly and release workflows broaden compatibility, lifecycle, provenance, and reproducibility coverage.

| CI concern | Local entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Core quality gates | `make ci-core` |
| Hugo documentation and redirects | `make docs-build` |
| Vendored dependencies and licenses | `make verify-vendor`, `make license-check` |
| Static and filesystem security | `make semgrep-ci`, `make security-ci` |
| Focused cluster behavior | `make test-e2e-ci`, `make helm-e2e-smoke` |
| Prior-stable operator upgrade | `make test-e2e-operator-upgrade` |
| Existing platform cluster | `make test-e2e-existing` |

Docs-only changes normally avoid broad cluster E2E. Backup, upgrade, security, provisioner, admission, controller-critical, or seal-path changes expand into targeted shards. Maintainers can request the full E2E set with the repository's CI label.

The E2E manifest owns suite routing, isolation, parallelism, and supported test versions. Do not duplicate those values in workflow logic. Run `make e2e-ci-matrix` or the nightly matrix commands before changing routing.

{{< callout type="note" title="Publishing requires more than PR CI" >}}
Edge, nightly, prerelease, and stable channels add immutable-subject, provenance, reproducibility, signing, and release-evidence gates. Passing `ci-core` does not authorize publication.
