The operator requires Kubernetes 1.33 or newer. The rows below describe the current validation baseline, not a blanket guarantee for every cloud, distribution, or topology.

## Kubernetes versions

| Version | Validation | Support posture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.35.x | Pull request, nightly, release, Helm, and upgrade coverage | Primary validated line |
| 1.34.x | Nightly and release-gate lifecycle coverage | Validated compatibility line |
| 1.33.x | Not validated for the current release line | May work; validate in staging before adoption |
| OpenShift | Manifest, Helm, admission, and focused platform coverage | Validate on the target cluster |

## OpenBao versions

| Version | Validation | Production note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.6.0 | Primary CI, nightly, release, and rolling-upgrade coverage | Primary validated target for 0.4.2 |
| Other 2.6.x | Best-effort support on the stable line; not release-gated by 0.4.2 | Validate the exact patch in staging |
| 2.5.x | Config compatibility and rolling-upgrade source coverage | Validate the transition in staging |
| 2.4.x | Config compatibility | Upgrade before a new production rollout |
| 2.3.x | Not validated | Out of support scope |

{{< callout type="warning" title="OpenBao 2.6 BlueGreen limitation" >}}
OpenBao 2.6 changed its internal request-forwarding gRPC service name. The operator blocks pre-2.6 to 2.6-or-newer
`BlueGreen` transitions until a compatible target is qualified. Fresh 2.6.0 clusters and rolling upgrades to 2.6.0
are the release-validated paths.

## Production upgrade rule

Validate the exact Kubernetes distribution, OpenBao version, unseal mechanism, storage, networking, and upgrade strategy in staging before changing production—even when both versions appear in the validated matrix.
