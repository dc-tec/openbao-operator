The operator coordinates sensitive infrastructure; it does not make every identity trusted. Review who can express intent, who may approve dangerous controls, and which component owns each secret or resource.

## Security routes

## Security profiles

`Hardened` requires explicit, reviewable production controls. `Development` permits a smaller evaluation setup and
must not be mistaken for an equivalent security posture. See [Choose a security profile](../configure/security-profile/)
for the enforced contract.

## Identity and admission

Creating a cluster does not automatically authorize every high-impact field. Delegated Kubernetes permissions protect
publication, custom images, trust roots, cloud identity references, restore controls, and other dangerous choices. See
[operator authorization](../get-started/operator-authorization/) for the grant procedure.

## Workload and tenant boundaries

The operator uses namespace-scoped delegation, managed-resource provenance, admission policy, security contexts, TLS, and network controls together. No single control substitutes for the rest.
Use [network policy](../configure/network/) and [service exposure and TLS](../configure/expose/) for the configuration
procedures; this section keeps only the security contracts that are not already owned there.

{{< callout type="warning" title="OpenBao still owns its own authorization" >}}
Kubernetes admission and operator RBAC govern the infrastructure control plane. OpenBao policies, auth methods, and audit configuration govern access inside OpenBao.
