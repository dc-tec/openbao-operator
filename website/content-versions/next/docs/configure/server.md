Keep the operator defaults until measured requirements justify a change. Server-runtime tuning is not a prerequisite
for the first cluster.

## Choose the correct configuration surface

| Surface | Controls |
| --- | --- |
| `spec.configuration` | UI, log level, cache, lease, listener, logging, Raft, and plugin-runtime settings |
| `spec.audit` | Declarative file, HTTP, syslog, or socket audit devices |
| `spec.plugins` | Declarative auth, secret, database, or KMS plugin declarations |
| `spec.configuration.raft.autopilot` | Raft health thresholds, quorum bounds, and dead-peer cleanup |

External exposure, TLS, NetworkPolicy, and observability are separate service-boundary decisions. File audit storage is
owned by the [storage guide](../storage/#configure-audit-file-storage).

## Tune the core runtime

Use `spec.configuration` for a specific OpenBao requirement, not as a copied collection of arbitrary values.

{{< command label="configure" title="Set selected server options" >}}
spec:
  configuration:
    ui: true
    logLevel: info
    defaultLeaseTTL: "24h"
    maxLeaseTTL: "720h"
    raft:
      performanceMultiplier: 2
{{< /command >}}

| Field | Change it when |
| --- | --- |
| `ui` | The built-in UI is intentionally enabled or disabled; route exposure is configured elsewhere |
| `logLevel` and `logging` | Operational evidence requires a different level, format, file, or rotation policy |
| `cacheSize` and `disableCache` | Profiling and workload behavior justify changing cache behavior |
| `defaultLeaseTTL` and `maxLeaseTTL` | Application lease policy requires explicit bounds |
| `raft.performanceMultiplier` | Measured disk or network latency justifies slower Raft timing |
| `listener.proxyProtocolBehavior` | The selected load balancer sends Proxy Protocol and the trust boundary is understood |

Valid Proxy Protocol values are `use_always`, `allow_any`, and `deny_unauthorized`. Do not use the upstream-looking
value `use_proxy_protocol`; the CRD rejects it. Keep listener TLS aligned with the later external-access design, and do
not set `listener.tlsDisable: true` on Hardened clusters.

The Hardened profile also rejects `detectDeadlocks`, `rawStorageEndpoint`, `introspectionEndpoint`, and
`unsafeAllowAPIAuditCreation`. Those flags expose debugging or unsafe runtime surfaces rather than normal operations.

## Require post-quantum TLS key exchange

Use `spec.configuration.listener` to restrict TLS versions and key exchange groups on the API and dedicated metrics
listeners. Omitted fields retain OpenBao's defaults. These settings do not configure cluster traffic on port 8201.

Before configuring key exchange groups, complete the upgrade to OpenBao 2.7.0 or later. Verify that the operator,
helper images, application clients, and metrics scrapers support at least one selected group. Admission rejects key
exchange settings while `status.currentVersion` reports an older OpenBao version.

This specification fragment requires TLS 1.3 and hybrid post-quantum key exchange:

{{< command label="configure" title="Require hybrid post-quantum key exchange" >}}
spec:
  version: "2.7.0"
  tls:
    enabled: true
    mode: OperatorManaged
    rotationPeriod: "720h"
  configuration:
    listener:
      tlsMinVersion: tls13
      tlsMaxVersion: tls13
      tlsKeyExchangePreferences:
        - X25519MLKEM768
        - SecP256r1MLKEM768
        - SecP384r1MLKEM1024
{{< /command >}}

`tlsMinVersion` and `tlsMaxVersion` accept `tls12` or `tls13`. The maximum must be greater than or equal to the minimum.
The version defaults are `tls12` and `tls13`, respectively. TLS settings require `spec.tls.enabled: true` and cannot
be combined with `listener.tlsDisable: true`.

`tlsKeyExchangePreferences` accepts the three hybrid groups above and the classical groups `X25519`, `CurveP256`,
`CurveP384`, and `CurveP521`. Each group can appear once. The list controls allowed groups; Go uses its own preference
order. A list containing only hybrid groups requires `tlsMinVersion: tls13`. Adding a classical group permits classical
fallback. Pure `MLKEM1024` is not accepted because the operator's default clients do not enable it.

The policy applies in `OperatorManaged`, `External`, and `ACME` TLS modes. `OperatorManaged` creates an ECDSA CA and
ECDSA server certificates. These certificates work with hybrid key exchange, but server authentication remains
classical. The policy does not select ML-DSA certificates or make every cluster connection post-quantum.

{{< callout type="warning" title="Check clients before requiring hybrid key exchange" >}}
Clients that support only classical key exchange cannot connect after enforcement. This includes application clients,
metrics scrapers, and TLS proxies. When a Gateway or ingress terminates TLS, configure its client-facing and backend
TLS connections independently, or use TLS passthrough.
{{< /callout >}}

After applying the fragment, inspect the generated configuration, workload revision, and cluster conditions. Check a
new TLS connection and record both TLS 1.3 and the negotiated hybrid group. TLS 1.3 alone does not prove post-quantum
key exchange. Confirm that a classical-only TLS 1.3 client and a TLS 1.2 client both fail to connect.

Listener changes use the workload configuration update path and require server restarts. Certificate hot reload does
not apply changed key exchange settings. Follow the configured rolling or blue/green update procedure and verify each
replica after it restarts. To permit classical clients again, add a classical group or remove the key exchange list,
then apply the same update procedure.

## Configure audit devices

Declare audit devices in `spec.audit` when they must exist as part of the cluster configuration. Supported structured
types are file, HTTP, syslog, and socket.

{{< command label="configure" title="Write file audit records to shared storage" >}}
spec:
  auditFileStorage:
    mode: ManagedPVC
    size: "20Gi"
    storageClassName: rwx-encrypted
  audit:
    - type: file
      path: secure-audit
      description: Secure audit logging
      fileOptions:
        filePath: /openbao/audit/audit.jsonl
        mode: "0600"
{{< /command >}}

The structured field is `fileOptions.filePath` in camel case. File paths must live under the effective
`auditFileStorage.mountPath`, which defaults to `/openbao/audit`.

| Type | Structured fields |
| --- | --- |
| File | `filePath` and optional octal `mode` |
| HTTP | `uri` and optional `headers` shaped as `map[string][]string` |
| Syslog | Optional `facility` and `tag` |
| Socket | Optional `address`, `socketType`, and `writeTimeout` |

The generic `options` object remains available for flat string-valued advanced options. Structured options take
precedence and reject nested objects or arrays except the typed HTTP headers field.

Audit storage is a collector handoff and replay buffer. It is not rotation, retention, tamper-proof archival, or a
complete collection pipeline.

## Register plugins

Use an OCI plugin when OpenBao can download the binary at startup. Use `command` only when the binary is already in the
runtime image or another deliberately managed path.

{{< command label="configure" title="Register an OCI plugin" >}}
spec:
  version: "2.6.2"
  configuration:
    plugin:
      autoDownload: true
      downloadBehavior: fail
  plugins:
    - type: secret
      name: example
      image: registry.example.com/openbao-plugin-secrets-example
      version: v1.0.0
      binaryName: openbao-plugin-secrets-example
      sha256sum: "<64-character-sha256>"
{{< /command >}}

{{< command label="configure" title="Register a preinstalled plugin" >}}
spec:
  plugins:
    - type: secret
      name: local-example
      command: openbao-plugin-secrets-example
      version: v1.0.0
      binaryName: openbao-plugin-secrets-example
      sha256sum: "<64-character-sha256>"
{{< /command >}}

Plugin requirements:

- `image` and `command` are mutually exclusive; one is required.
- Plugin download settings require OpenBao 2.5.0 or newer.
- `downloadBehavior: fail` stops startup after a failed download; `continue` logs the failure and continues.
- `args` and `env` are used only when `autoRegister` is enabled.
- OCI-downloaded binaries use a writable pod-local `emptyDir` at `/openbao/plugins`. It is a cache, not durable storage.
- OpenBao's runtime OCI client needs registry egress and its own authentication. Kubernetes `imagePullSecrets` cover
  Kubernetes image pulls, not necessarily plugin downloads inside the container.
- An identity selecting a plugin `image` or `command` needs delegated `usecustomexecutables` authority on the cluster.
- A plugin with `type: kms` can back `spec.unseal.type: kms` on OpenBao 2.6.0 and later. Its name must match
  `spec.unseal.kms.pluginName`; see [Configure unseal](../unseal/#configure-a-plugin-backed-kms-seal).

## Understand Raft Autopilot defaults

After initialization, the operator reconciles these effective defaults:

| Setting | Effective default |
| --- | --- |
| `deadServerLastContactThreshold` | `5m` |
| `lastContactThreshold` | `10s` |
| `maxTrailingLogs` | `1000` |
| `serverStabilizationTime` | `10s` |
| Hardened `minQuorum` | `3` for three voters; all voters when replicas exceed three |
| Development `minQuorum` | Replica count, with a minimum of one |
| `cleanupDeadServers` | `true`, except it is automatically disabled for a derived quorum below three unless explicitly overridden |

The CRD requires an explicitly configured `minQuorum` to be at least three. Small Development clusters can still have
a derived value below three; automatic cleanup is then disabled so OpenBao does not reject the configuration.

For self-init clusters, day-2 Autopilot reconciliation requires operator JWT bootstrap. Without
`selfInit.oidc.enabled`, the operator skips that authenticated reconciliation after initialization. Standard-init
clusters use the operator-managed root-token Secret.

Override Autopilot only after measuring the failure or latency behavior you need to change:

{{< command label="configure" title="Override Raft Autopilot" >}}
spec:
  profile: Hardened
  replicas: 5
  configuration:
    raft:
      autopilot:
        minQuorum: 4
        deadServerLastContactThreshold: "10m"
        lastContactThreshold: "30s"
        maxTrailingLogs: 2000
        serverStabilizationTime: "30s"
{{< /command >}}

If you set `cleanupDeadServers: false`, you take manual ownership of dead-peer removal. Treat that as a controlled
operational exception.

## Inspect the schema and rendered state

{{< command label="inspect" title="Inspect configuration fields" >}}
kubectl explain openbaocluster.spec.configuration
kubectl explain openbaocluster.spec.audit
kubectl explain openbaocluster.spec.plugins
{{< /command >}}

After an update, inspect the `OpenBaoCluster` conditions, generated ConfigMap, StatefulSet revision, Pod events, and
OpenBao logs. A schema-valid option can still be incompatible with the selected OpenBao version or external runtime.
