The workload controller converges the resources needed to run OpenBao. First boot is deliberately different from steady
state: the operator starts one pod, confirms initialization, and only then applies the requested replica count.

## Reconcile in dependency order

The application layer runs the workload reconcilers in this order:

1. Reconcile certificate material or verify its readiness.
2. Reconcile infrastructure. This step validates the version and image, computes safe StatefulSet intent, renders
   bootstrap configuration, and then reconciles networking, identity, and voter and read-replica workloads.
3. Reconcile storage expansion and any restart needed to observe it.
4. Reconcile initialization while the cluster is uninitialized.
5. Reconcile Day 2 Autopilot settings after initialization, when no upgrade blocks the change.

The infrastructure step is an application-level sequence, not six independent top-level reconcilers. That ordering keeps
configuration and resource identity aligned before the workload is applied.

## Keep service write surfaces narrow

| Service | Primary responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Certificates | Create or observe TLS material; request in-pod reload before OpenBao 2.7 |
| Bootstrap and configuration | Render `config.hcl`, self-init requests, seal prerequisites, ACME cache storage, and managed audit-file storage |
| Networking | Reconcile Services, Ingress or Gateway resources, backend trust, and NetworkPolicies |
| Identity | Reconcile the workload ServiceAccount and namespaced RBAC |
| Workload | Reconcile voter and read-replica StatefulSets, PodDisruptionBudgets, revision resources, and rollout triggers |
| Storage | Reconcile volume expansion and controlled restart progress |
| Initialization | Detect or perform initialization, persist the appropriate status, and make the first Autopilot attempt |

The services share three contracts:

- `internal/service/configuration` keeps `config.hcl` semantics consistent between normal bootstrap and blue-green startup;
- `internal/platform/resourceidentity` keeps names, labels, and selectors consistent;
- `internal/platform/resourceapply` provides owner-aware server-side apply behavior while service-specific exceptions stay
  with the owning service.

## Apply the TLS ownership model

| Mode | Certificate owner | Certificate service behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OperatorManaged` | Operator | Create and rotate the CA and server Secrets |
| `External` | User or external controller | Wait for the required Secrets and validate them when their content changes |
| `ACME` | OpenBao | Do not create or watch certificate Secrets; OpenBao and the rendered listener configuration own issuance and cache lifecycle |

Certificate changes do not require a StatefulSet rollout. With OpenBao 2.7.0 or later, the operator enables
`tls_auto_reload` on the API listener and the optional metrics-only listener. OpenBao polls the mounted certificate and
key files every 10 seconds. Earlier versions use the in-pod wrapper to poll `tls.crt` every 10 seconds and send
`SIGHUP` when its content changes. For those versions, the certificate service also records the active certificate
hash on ready Pods. Kubernetes must project a changed Secret into the Pod before either watcher can reload it.

{{< callout type="note" title="ACME is outside the certificate service" >}}
The certificate service returns without action in ACME mode. Listener rendering and cache prerequisites belong to the
bootstrap and configuration path; live issuance belongs to OpenBao.

## Initialize one pod, then scale

The workload specification is capped at one voter until `status.initialized` is true. This prevents multiple fresh pods
from racing to form the first Raft cluster.

### Self-initialization

OpenBao performs its own initialization. The initialization service observes readiness, health, and registration state,
then sets `status.initialized` and `status.selfInitialized`. It does not create a root-token Secret. After success, it
makes the self-init request ConfigMap inert so a later restart cannot replay the bootstrap request.

### Operator initialization

The initialization service waits for the first pod and required TLS material, checks whether the cluster is already
initialized, and calls the init API only when needed. It stores the returned root token in the cluster root-token Secret
without logging the init response, then marks the cluster initialized.

Detecting an already initialized cluster is a recovery path for an operator-managed cluster. It does not turn the CRD
into an import API for unmanaged clusters.

### Autopilot and scale-out

Initialization makes an initial attempt to configure Raft Autopilot. A separate Day 2 reconciler retries and applies
later Autopilot changes after initialization. It yields while an upgrade owns the relevant lifecycle state.

Once initialization status is durable, the infrastructure path removes the one-pod cap. Additional voter and read
replica pods join through the rendered Raft configuration. Safe scale-down and restart ordering are computed before the
StatefulSets are applied.

## Reconcile approved policies

With `spec.reconcilePolicies: true`, the workload controller verifies built-in OpenBao policies after the workload
steps, including when a step fails or requests a retry. A policy error does not prevent infrastructure repair or
Autopilot reconciliation. The controller reads each policy and writes only missing or changed contents. Failure to
repair one policy does not stop verification of the others.

Successful verification is cached for five minutes across pod events and controller restarts. A change to the desired
runtime policies bypasses this interval. The runtime revision tracks the selected strategy's policy, independently of
the approval document that permits both strategies. During an unfinished upgrade, reconciliation retains the accepted
strategy's permissions, including when its operation lock must be recovered. After completion it applies the requested
strategy's policy.

Forbidden requests (403) and missing auth or write endpoints (404) retry after five minutes. Other failures retry after
30 seconds. Unrelated reconciles respect the persisted retry deadline; a desired policy change bypasses it.
External drift is detected at the next verification while reconciliation and OpenBao are available.

The workload status records individual policy observations and the last successful complete verification. Policy
errors are separate from other workload errors and appear in `PolicyReconciliationReady`, `Degraded`, and warning
events. A warning event is emitted on the first failure or when its message changes. See
[status and events](../../reference/status-and-events/#policy-reconciliation-status) for the fields and
[operation gating](../operations/#check-policy-readiness-per-operation) for their consumers.

## Preserve the handoff

| Boundary | Required outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Before the first pod | TLS or ACME prerequisites, configuration, networking, identity, and storage are ready enough for startup |
| Before initialization | Pod 0 is reachable through the configured trust path |
| Before scale-out | Initialization is confirmed in status; self-init bootstrap requests cannot replay |
| During steady state | Generated resources remain operator-owned and changes route through the custom resource |
| During an upgrade | Workload repair continues, but Autopilot and rollout changes respect upgrade ordering |
