`spec.backup.restoreTest` restores the latest successful backup into a disposable
[new cluster](../new-cluster/) on a schedule or after a number of backups. The result is recorded on the source
cluster and exported as metrics.

{{< callout type="note" title="Guarantees and limits" >}}
- A test passes when the snapshot digest recorded by the backup matches before submission, and the target then
  reports the source cluster ID, version, and healthy leadership.
- It does not test logins or read stored secrets.
- One test runs at a time. Status keeps the last result only, not a history.
- The destination namespace is in the source's Kubernetes cluster. For another Kubernetes cluster, create a
  [restore request there](../new-cluster/#restore-in-another-kubernetes-cluster).
- Operator retention protects the snapshot under test. Bucket lifecycle rules and external retention tools do not
  know about it.

## Before you begin

1. Prepare and approve a destination namespace. See [Prepare a recovery namespace](../prepare-namespace/).
2. Prepare destination storage credentials and access to the original unseal key. The configured unseal provider must
   decrypt the source snapshot. Storage connection settings come from the source backup configuration; `credentialsSecretRef` selects
   the destination credentials.
3. Give the person configuring the test permission in the destination namespace to create restores and clusters,
   perform restores, `get` the referenced Secrets, and `use` the StorageClass and any ServiceAccount. Custom images
   and workload identities need their usual delegation permissions there.

## Configure a trigger

Add `restoreTest` beneath `spec.backup`. Use either `everySuccessfulBackups` or a five-field UTC cron `schedule`.

```yaml
restoreTest:
  everySuccessfulBackups: 7
  # Alternatively: schedule: "0 4 * * 0"
  namespace: recovery-tests
  credentialsSecretRef:
    name: recovery-storage
  cleanupAfterSeconds: 300
  clusterTemplate:
    version: "2.7.1"
    storage:
      size: 10Gi
    tls:
      enabled: true
      mode: OperatorManaged
      rotationPeriod: 720h
    unseal:
      type: transit
      credentialsSecretRef:
        name: recovery-transit
      transit:
        address: https://seal.example.com:8200
        mountPath: transit
        keyName: production-unseal
        tlsCACert: /etc/bao/seal-creds/ca.crt
```

Targets get generated names and require `OperatorManaged` TLS. `cleanupAfterSeconds` keeps a target for inspection
after application is confirmed, up to 24 hours. The default is immediate cleanup. Failed targets are always cleaned up.

Removing `restoreTest` stops new runs and removes the metrics. A running test still finishes cleanup, and the last
result stays in status.

## Read the result

Read `status.backup.restoreTest` on the source cluster:

- `last.outcome` is `Passed` or `Failed`. `last.reason` and `last.message` retain a bounded diagnostic after cleanup.
- `last.namespace`, `last.key`, and `last.digest` identify the destination and pinned snapshot. The digest is present
  when the test request was observed or its creation was definitively rejected.
- `lastSuccessTime` keeps the latest pass across later failures.
- `active` names the running test's `OpenBaoRestore` and the snapshot key.
- The `Passed` condition explains the current state.

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `openbao_restore_test_success{namespace,name}` | 1 if the latest test passed, 0 if it failed |
| `openbao_restore_test_last_success_timestamp_seconds` | Time of the latest pass, or 0 |

Alert on the age of the last-success timestamp. A past pass does not show that tests still run.

| `Passed` reason | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Running` | A test is in progress. | None. |
| `NoCompatibleSnapshot` | No backup yet records a source identity matching the template version. Backups from older executors lack it. | Wait for a new backup, or align `clusterTemplate.version`. |
| `InvalidSchedule` | The cron expression cannot be parsed. | Fix `schedule`. |
| `DestinationRejected` | Admission rejected the test request, for example a missing namespace approval or permission. A pre-check rejection consumes no run; a rejection at creation records `Failed`. | Fix the namespace or permissions. The next due run proceeds. |
| `CleanupBlocked` | The test target's cleanup failed. No further test starts. | Resolve it as in [Resolve blocked cleanup](../new-cluster/#resolve-blocked-cleanup). |
| `RequestMissing` | The operator could not confirm that the test request was created, for example after an API timeout. It never retries, so no further test starts and source deletion waits. | Inspect the destination, make sure no older controller is still running, then acknowledge the exact run as described below. |
| `RequestReplaced` | An object the operator did not create holds the test request's name. | Inspect the replacement and its owner, then acknowledge the exact run as described below. |

If a test request is deleted or replaced after the operator recorded it, the operator records `Failed`, ends the run,
and leaves the replacement alone.

## Release an uncertain run

For `RequestMissing` or `RequestReplaced`, inspect the destination and stop any older controller that could complete
a delayed request creation. Take responsibility for remaining destination resources. Then acknowledge the exact run
on the source cluster; do not edit its status subresource.

```bash
run=$(kubectl -n <source-namespace> get openbaocluster <source-cluster> -o jsonpath='{.status.backup.restoreTest.active.name}')
kubectl -n <source-namespace> annotate openbaocluster <source-cluster> \
  "openbao.org/restore-test-acknowledge=${run}/Release" --overwrite
```

This requires patch access and the `restore` verb on the source cluster, plus admission permissions for its configured
resources. Check that `active` is empty and `last.reason` is `AdministratorReleased`. The acknowledgement cannot
release a recorded request's cleanup or delete a replacement. It also works with testing disabled and during source
deletion. A consumed acknowledgement cannot release a later run; remove it when convenient.

An enabled schedule can start a later due run after release. Preserve external logs if you need detailed provider or
executor errors: the operator keeps only one sanitized result and deletes the test request and target.

To run a single test from a separate recovery cluster, create a disposable `OpenBaoRestore` with the source identity,
version, and digest as in [Restore into a new cluster](../new-cluster/).
