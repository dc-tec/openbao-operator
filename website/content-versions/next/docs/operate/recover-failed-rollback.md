The current break-glass surface is specific to failed blue-green rollback work. It halts blue-green reconciliation
until `spec.breakGlassAck` matches the current status nonce. Acknowledgment means “retry the halted automation”; it is
not a repair by itself.

## Read the recorded failure

{{< command label="inspect" title="Capture break-glass and rollback state" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> get openbaocluster <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.breakGlass}' | jq
kubectl -n <namespace> get openbaocluster <name> \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.blueGreen.phase}{"\n"}{.status.blueGreen.lastJobFailure}{"\n"}'
kubectl -n <namespace> get jobs -l openbao.org/cluster=<name>
kubectl -n <namespace> logs job/<job-from-status>
{{< /command >}}

| Reason | Expected phase | Repair boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RollbackConsensusRepairFailed` | `RollingBack` | Inspect the rollback repair Job, Pod health, and current Raft membership |
| `RollbackCleanupPeerRemovalFailed` | `RollbackCleanup` | Confirm stale Green peers have been removed or can be removed safely |

The status `steps` are generated for the specific failed Job. Follow them before applying a generic procedure.

Raft inspection requires an authenticated OpenBao session with configuration read access. Use your approved
interactive login path; do not put a privileged token in the command line or shell history.

## Stabilize the cluster

Inspect Pods and membership from a healthy voter:

{{< command label="inspect" title="Check rollback health" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -l openbao.org/cluster=<name> -o wide
kubectl -n <namespace> exec <healthy-pod> -- bao status
kubectl -n <namespace> exec <healthy-pod> -- bao operator raft list-peers
{{< /command >}}

If direct Pod work is required, use [planned maintenance](../maintenance/) so admission has an explicit maintenance
signal. Pause the cluster while performing a longer manual repair if normal reconciliation would race your change.

Do not lower `spec.version` to escape the incident. Downgrades below `status.currentVersion` are blocked, and changing
the requested version does not repair rollback membership.

## Acknowledge only after repair

Copy the current nonce immediately before the acknowledgment. A later break-glass event has a different nonce.

{{< command label="apply" title="Acknowledge the current break-glass event" >}}
NONCE=$(kubectl -n <namespace> get openbaocluster <name> \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.breakGlass.nonce}')
kubectl -n <namespace> patch openbaocluster <name> --type merge -p "{
  \"spec\": {
    \"breakGlassAck\": \"${NONCE}\"
  }
}"
{{< /command >}}

For either current reason, a matching acknowledgment clears active break glass, increments the rollback attempt,
clears the recorded Job failure count, and schedules a new rollback or cleanup attempt. Watch the replacement Job and
`status.blueGreen.phase`.

## Restore when rollback repair is no longer trustworthy

If the cluster state cannot be repaired safely, select a known-good snapshot and use the forced lock-override path in
[Restore a snapshot](../restore/). That path is destructive and must be a separate, immutable `OpenBaoRestore`
request. Do not acknowledge rollback automation and start a forced restore concurrently.
