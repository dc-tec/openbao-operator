The operator creates a transient Job for each due or manually requested backup. The Job authenticates to OpenBao,
streams a Raft snapshot to object storage, and records the result on `status.backup`. Snapshot bytes do not pass
through the controller.

## Before you begin

Prepare two independent identities:

1. An OpenBao identity that can read `sys/storage/raft/snapshot`. Prefer a JWT role bound to the generated
   `<cluster>-backup-serviceaccount`; use `tokenSecretRef` only as a compatibility path.
2. An object-storage identity. Use `credentialsSecretRef`, workload-identity metadata, or S3 `roleArn`.

When self-init OIDC bootstrap is enabled, an empty `jwtAuthRole` resolves to `openbao-operator-backup` and the operator
creates the policy and role during initial bootstrap. Otherwise, configure `jwtAuthRole` or `tokenSecretRef` explicitly.

Hardened clusters also require explicit, port-scoped `spec.network.egressRules` and an explicit storage identity. See
[Configure network policy](../../configure/network/).

## Configure an S3 backup

This is the preferred minimal shape when self-init OIDC bootstrap is enabled:

{{< command label="configure" title="Schedule an S3 snapshot" >}}
spec:
  backup:
    schedule: "0 3 * * *"
    target:
      provider: s3
      endpoint: https://s3.amazonaws.com
      bucket: openbao-backups
      region: us-east-1
      pathPrefix: clusters
      credentialsSecretRef:
        name: s3-backup-credentials
    retention:
      maxCount: 14
      maxAge: 336h
{{< /command >}}

`schedule` is a five-field cron expression. The default provider is `s3`, but set it explicitly so intent remains
clear.

| Provider | Required target fields | Secret keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S3 | `endpoint`, `bucket`; `region` defaults to `us-east-1` | `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`; optional `sessionToken`, `region`, `caCert` |
| GCS | `bucket`; optional `gcs.project` and endpoint | `credentials.json` |
| Azure | `bucket`, `azure.storageAccount`; optional `azure.container` and endpoint | `accountKey` or `connectionString` |

For platform workload identity, set `target.workloadIdentity.serviceAccountAnnotations` and, when required,
`target.workloadIdentity.podLabels`. For S3 web identity, `target.roleArn` also projects an STS token and configures the
Job explicitly.

{{< callout type="warning" title="Storage identity is separate from unseal identity" >}}
Backup Jobs use their own ServiceAccount. A cloud identity attached to the OpenBao workload is not inherited by the
backup Job. Bind the generated backup ServiceAccount or supply storage credentials deliberately.
{{< /callout >}}

## Use a static OpenBao token only when needed

If JWT auth is unavailable, create a same-namespace Secret whose `token` value can read the Raft snapshot endpoint,
then reference it:

{{< command label="configure" title="Reference a backup token" >}}
spec:
  backup:
    tokenSecretRef:
      name: openbao-backup-token
{{< /command >}}

`jwtAuthRole` takes precedence when both fields are present. Rotate and revoke a static token as a high-sensitivity
credential.

## Delegate configuration safely

The identity that changes the `OpenBaoCluster` needs:

- `get` on each referenced Secret
- `usecloudidentities` on the cluster when it sets `roleArn` or workload-identity metadata
- `usecustomexecutables` on the cluster when it overrides `spec.backup.image` (`usehelperimages` remains a compatibility alias)

Admission rejects loopback and link-local storage endpoints. Hardened clusters also reject insecure TLS and ambient
storage identity.

## Trigger and verify a backup

The operator does not create a CronJob. Trigger an immediate backup by changing the one-shot annotation value:

{{< command label="apply" title="Request a manual backup" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> annotate openbaocluster <name> \
  openbao.org/trigger-backup="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --overwrite
{{< /command >}}

The controller clears the annotation after accepting the request. It skips a duplicate request while another backup
Job is active.

{{< command label="verify" title="Inspect backup readiness and outcome" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> get openbaocluster <name> \
  -o jsonpath='{range .status.conditions[?(@.type=="BackupConfigurationReady")]}{.status}{" "}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}{end}'
kubectl -n <namespace> get openbaocluster <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.backup}' | jq
kubectl -n <namespace> get jobs -l openbao.org/cluster=<name>
{{< /command >}}

A successful run advances `lastBackupTime`, `lastBackupName`, `lastBackupSize`, and `lastBackupDuration`. Failure
details are in `lastFailureReason`, `lastFailureMessage`, and `lastFailureTime`. Confirm the object independently in
storage before relying on it.

## Set retention and pre-upgrade snapshots

`maxCount: 0` and an empty `maxAge` mean unlimited retention. The operator applies retention after a successful
upload and never turns a retention error into a failed snapshot.

{{< callout type="note" title="Retention currently needs a credentials Secret" >}}
Controller-side retention runs only when `target.credentialsSecretRef` is configured. It is skipped for `roleArn`,
workload identity, and other provider-default identity paths. Apply storage-native lifecycle rules for those paths.
{{< /callout >}}

Enable `spec.upgrade.preUpgradeSnapshot: true` to require a snapshot before either upgrade strategy. Blue-green also
accepts `spec.upgrade.blueGreen.preUpgradeSnapshot`, but the top-level field keeps one policy across strategies. The
upgrade does not continue if its required snapshot fails.

A backup is complete only after you [restore it into an isolated target](../restore/) and validate the recovered data.
