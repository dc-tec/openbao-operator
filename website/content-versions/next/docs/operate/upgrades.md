Use `RollingUpdate` unless you need parallel validation or a manual traffic cutover. Both strategies require a healthy
cluster, a supported target version, and a working upgrade identity.

## Choose the strategy

| Strategy | Use it when | Failure boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RollingUpdate` | You want the default, lower-capacity rollout | The operator updates one Pod at a time, coordinates leader step-down, and holds a failed rollout for an explicit retry |
| `BlueGreen` | You need a parallel Green revision, validation hook, or manual promotion | The operator joins Green as non-voters, promotes it, cuts over, and can abort or roll back according to phase |

{{< callout type="warning" title="Use rolling for a pre-2.6 to 2.6-or-newer transition" >}}
The operator rejects blue-green upgrades from an OpenBao version before 2.6 to version 2.6 or newer. The mixed-version
request-forwarding path cannot be qualified safely. Switch an idle cluster to `RollingUpdate` first.
{{< /callout >}}

Check the [compatibility matrix](../../reference/compatibility/) and the upstream release notes before choosing the
target.

## Prepare the rollout

{{< checklist title="Preflight" >}}
- `Available=True`, `Degraded` is not true, and all declared voter replicas are Ready.
- `status.currentVersion` matches the current `spec.version`.
- No backup, restore, resize, restart, upgrade, Green revision, or break-glass recovery is active.
- A recent snapshot exists and its restore path has been rehearsed.
- The upgrade JWT role has the health, step-down, and Raft capabilities required by the selected strategy.
- The target version and any explicit image are allowed by the compatibility and image-verification policies.
{{< /checklist >}}

Enable a mandatory recovery point for the next change:

{{< command label="configure" title="Require a pre-upgrade snapshot" >}}
spec:
  upgrade:
    preUpgradeSnapshot: true
{{< /command >}}

This requires a valid `spec.backup`. The operator acquires an operation lock so an upgrade, backup, and restore do not
perform conflicting long-running work.

## Change strategies on an existing cluster

Change only the strategy, then wait for the operator to accept it. Do not combine the strategy transition with a
version, image, replica, storage, or restart change.

{{< command label="apply" title="Switch to rolling update" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> patch openbaocluster <name> --type merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "upgrade": {
      "strategy": "RollingUpdate"
    }
  }
}'
{{< /command >}}

{{< command label="verify" title="Wait for strategy acceptance" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> get openbaocluster <name> \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.acceptedUpgradeStrategy}{"\n"}'
{{< /command >}}

Before switching to `BlueGreen`, configure `spec.upgrade.jwtAuthRole` or use the default
`openbao-operator-upgrade` role created by self-init OIDC bootstrap. A role created for a rolling-only cluster might
need its policy expanded before the switch; self-init requests are not replayed later.

## Request the version change

After the strategy is accepted, change `spec.version` in a separate request:

{{< command label="apply" title="Request the target version" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> patch openbaocluster <name> --type merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "version": "<target-version>"
  }
}'
{{< /command >}}

The version must be semantic version syntax. The operator blocks downgrades below `status.currentVersion`. If you set
`spec.image`, keep a semantic tag aligned with `spec.version`; digest-pinned images still use `spec.version` as the
upgrade intent.

## Control a blue-green promotion

Set `spec.upgrade.blueGreen.autoPromote: false` before the upgrade begins to hold a healthy Green revision in
`Syncing`. Approve it by changing the one-shot request value:

{{< command label="apply" title="Approve a held promotion" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> patch openbaocluster <name> --type merge -p "{
  \"spec\": {
    \"upgrade\": {
      \"requests\": {
        \"promote\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"
      }
    }
  }
}"
{{< /command >}}

`autoPromote` is snapshotted when an upgrade starts. Changing it during an in-flight upgrade affects only the next
upgrade.

When a BlueGreen validation hook is configured, the operator verifies its image through
`spec.operatorImageVerification` before creating the Job and pins a successful result by digest. `Block` stops the
upgrade when verification fails; `Warn` keeps the original reference and is not permitted by the Hardened profile.
The Job disables ServiceAccount token automounting, runs non-root with a read-only root filesystem, drops all
capabilities, uses RuntimeDefault seccomp, inherits `spec.imagePullSecrets`, and receives bounded resources.

## Recover a held rolling failure

Fix the cause recorded in `status.upgrade.failure`, then change `spec.upgrade.requests.retry`:

{{< command label="apply" title="Retry a rolling upgrade" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> patch openbaocluster <name> --type merge -p "{
  \"spec\": {
    \"upgrade\": {
      \"requests\": {
        \"retry\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"
      }
    }
  }
}"
{{< /command >}}

Each request is edge-triggered: use a new non-empty value. For blue-green rollback repair failures, use
[Recover a failed rollback](../recover-failed-rollback/) instead of retrying blindly.

## Verify the result

{{< command label="verify" title="Watch upgrade state" >}}
kubectl -n <namespace> get openbaocluster <name> -w
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -l openbao.org/cluster=<name> -o wide
kubectl -n <namespace> get events --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
{{< /command >}}

Finish only when `status.currentVersion` equals `spec.version`, `status.phase=Running`, `Available=True`, all declared
replicas are Ready, and Raft membership matches the intended topology.
