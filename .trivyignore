# Trivy ignore file for intentional security configurations
#
# This file documents security findings that are intentional and required
# for the OpenBao Operator architecture.

# NOTE:
# Trivy ignorefiles are for ignoring rules/IDs (e.g. CVEs, AVD-*, secret detectors).
# They do NOT reliably support "ignore this file path" across all scanner types.
#
# For intentionally-privileged RBAC manifests/templates we use Trivy's
# --skip-files flags in CI and in `make security-scan` instead.

# Trivy secret scanner false positive: the GCP sample contains a commented example
# service-account JSON snippet that matches the detector.
