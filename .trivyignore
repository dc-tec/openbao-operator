# Skip misconfig checks for the provisioner delegate template
# This ClusterRole is a template that defines maximum permissions that can
# be delegated to tenants. The broad permissions are architecturally required
# due to Kubernetes RBAC escalation checks. See the security notice in
# config/rbac/provisioner_delegate_clusterrole.yaml for details.
